# Repo Working Agreements

## Git workflow
- Commit after every code change.
- Push to `origin main` after every 20 local commits, or when explicitly asked.

## Git identity (User vs Agent)
- User commits (VS Code): `ctf2090 <ctf2090@gmail.com>`
- Agent commits (Codex): `codex <codex@local>`
- Preferred setup: keep repo `user.name/user.email` for the user; the agent overrides per commit:
  - `git -c user.name=codex -c user.email=codex@local commit --no-gpg-sign -m "..."`

## Communication
- The user is not a native English speaker. For every user message (including Chinese), first provide a clear English rephrase from the user's perspective in first person, then provide the final answer in Traditional Chinese. Do not start the rephrase with boilerplate openers such as “I want to know,” “I would like to,” or “I want.”
- Do not start the English rephrase with `I’m asking`. Prefer direct first-person phrasing such as `I prefer...`, `I need...`, `Please...`, or another concise first-person/user-perspective form that matches the request.
- For a single user message, provide the English rephrase once at the start of the turn. Do not repeat the same rephrase in intermediary progress updates; only rephrase again after a new user message arrives.
- When the final answer is written in Chinese, do not include an automatic English translation unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- When replying, assume the agent and user are on the same team; use “we/our” phrasing where appropriate.
- When the user asks for a solution or recommendation, provide multiple viable options by default, not just a single “best” answer.
- For each option, include a one-line tradeoff (cost/time/risk/complexity) so the user can choose.
- If the right choice depends on unknown constraints, ask 1–2 short clarifying questions, but still provide a best-effort set of options based on common assumptions.
- If you use an uncommon English term, include a brief Traditional Chinese translation the first time you use it (for example: “orchestrator (流程編排器)”).
- For timestamps in logs/messages/docs, default to `Asia/Taipei (UTC+8)` unless the user explicitly asks for another timezone.

## New chat bootstrap
- Run `git status -sb` to understand the repo state.
- Scan the repo layout with `ls` and prefer `rg --files` for fast file discovery.
- For a new Codespace project, ensure `gh` and `rg` are installed; install them if missing.
- Reply with a short plan and the current repo status before making changes.

## .md
- Read .md from the root folder and its sub-folders, if it exists.

## Feature policy
- For new features, default to no backward compatibility unless the user explicitly requests compatibility support.
